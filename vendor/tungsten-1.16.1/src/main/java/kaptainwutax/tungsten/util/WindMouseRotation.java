/**
 * WindMouse-based rotation smoother for human-like yaw/pitch movement.
 *
 * Architecture (two-phase):
 *   1. Game tick  — setTarget(yaw, pitch): store desired facing, do NOT touch player.
 *   2. Render frame — applyRenderStep(player): one WindMouse step → player.setYaw/setPitch.
 *
 * Running at render frequency (~60 FPS vs 20 TPS) makes the rotation look genuinely
 * smooth instead of snapping every 50 ms, which anti-cheats detect.
 *
 * Singleton: WindMouseRotation.INSTANCE — shared across all follow tasks.
